# ShopNest Store Capstone

## Overview
The *ShopNest Store Capstone* project is part of the final evaluation for the e-commerce marketplace analytics course. It aims to analyze a retail dataset from ShopNest, a leading department store in Portugal that connects small businesses to customers through a seamless e-commerce platform.

The project involves designing a comprehensive *Power BI dashboard* to answer key business analytics questions based on the provided datasets. The dashboard provides insights into product categories, order delays, payment methods, product ratings, state-wise sales, seasonal patterns, and overall revenue analysis.

## Datasets
The analysis is based on *9 datasets*, each containing anonymized commercial information related to ShopNest operations. The primary datasets include:

### 1. *Customers Dataset*
- *Customer ID*: Key to the orders dataset. Each order has a unique customer ID.
- *Customer Zip Code*: First five digits of customer zip code.
- *Customer City*: City of the customer.
- *Customer State*: State of the customer.

### 2. *Geolocation Dataset*
Data related to the geographic location of customers and stores.
